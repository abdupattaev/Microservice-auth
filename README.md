**Project Name: Microservice Authentication**


**Overview**

This project implements a Spring application using a microservice architecture. The primary focus is on managing authentication and authorization for various microservices through a Spring Cloud API Gateway. The API Gateway interfaces with a dedicated user-identity service to validate user credentials and permissions before routing requests to the respective microservices.


**Features**

Spring Cloud API Gateway: Serves as the entry point for all microservices, handling routing, authentication, and authorization.
User-Identity Service: Manages user authentication and provides authorization tokens.
Microservices Integration: Seamless integration of various microservices through the API Gateway.


Instructions on how to run the application:

Start the user-identity service.

Launch the API Gateway.
